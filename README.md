# Pokemon Database
This is a simple pokemon database to practice using Typescript, Vue.js, and Nuxt (as opposed to my usual React and Next.js)

The app retrieves the first 60 pokemon from pokeapi. You can filter the results with the search bar, and click on a pokemon to open an more detailed profile page:
